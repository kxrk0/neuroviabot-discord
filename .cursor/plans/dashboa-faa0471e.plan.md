# Fix Frontend Build & Complete Remaining TODOs

## Issue Analysis

The VPS shows `neuroviabot-frontend` in **errored** state with Next.js build error: "Could not find a production build in the '.next' directory"

## Root Causes

1. **Missing React Icons Import**: Marketplace page uses icons but might be missing imports
2. **Build Process**: Frontend may need rebuild after recent changes
3. **Remaining TODOs**: Some plan items still marked as incomplete

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Fix Marketplace Page Imports

- Add missing icon imports (ArrowRightOnRectangleIcon, Cog6ToothIcon, CommandLineIcon, ChevronDownIcon)
- Fix AuditLog component imports
- Ensure all dependencies are properly imported

### Step 2: Fix AuditLog Component

- Complete missing icon imports
- Fix TypeScript types
- Ensure date-fns is installed

### Step 3: Rebuild Frontend

- Run `npm install` in frontend directory
- Run `npm run build` to create production build
- Verify `.next` directory is created
- Test locally before deploying

### Step 4: Complete Remaining TODOs

- Verify all dashboard routes are updated
- Ensure all navigation links point to correct routes
- Confirm all components are properly integrated

### Step 5: Deploy & Verify

- Commit fixes
- Push to GitHub
- Verify GitHub Actions deployment
- Check PM2 status on VPS
- Test live site

## Files to Modify

1. `neuroviabot-frontend/components/dashboard/AuditLog.tsx` - Fix imports
2. `neuroviabot-frontend/package.json` - Verify dependencies
3. Rebuild and redeploy
