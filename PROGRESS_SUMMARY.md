# NeuroViaBot Development Progress Summary

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### Core System Fixes
1. **PWA Manifest** - Created proper `manifest.json` with all required fields
2. **Developer Badge** - Fixed visibility in navbar and dropdown with consistent logic
3. **Socket.IO Stabilization** - Enhanced client-side reconnection with exponential backoff and ACK handling
4. **Socket.IO Server** - Implemented proper guild room management with error handling
5. **Audit Log API** - Fixed route with pagination, filtering, and proper error responses
6. **MongoDB Integration** - Improved connection handling with retry logic and health checks
7. **AuditLog Frontend** - Rebuilt component with guildId validation and real-time updates
8. **Environment Documentation** - Created `.env.example` files for both frontend and backend
9. **Deployment Guide** - Comprehensive `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` with all steps

### Frontend Enhancements
10. **API Layer** - Enhanced with retry logic, exponential backoff, and custom APIError class
11. **Error Handling** - Global ErrorBoundary and error pages with user-friendly messages
12. **Skeleton Loaders** - Created reusable loading components (Card, Table, Grid, List, etc.)
13. **Clipboard Copy** - Added copy-to-clipboard for commands with visual feedback
14. **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Implemented global shortcuts system (/, g, h, k, ?)
15. **Progressive UI** - Loading states and skeleton components throughout the app
16. **Performance Optimizations** - Code already uses Next.js optimizations (next/image, dynamic imports)
17. **Accessibility** - prefers-reduced-motion support, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation

### Pages Review
- `/ozellikler` ✅ - Modern design with glassmorphism and animations
- `/iletisim` ✅ - Well-designed contact page with validation
- `/geri-bildirim` ✅ - Feedback page with rating system
- `/servers` ✅ - Server list with grid layout and bot status
- `/manage/[serverId]` ✅ - Comprehensive management dashboard with sidebar navigation
- `/nrc/about` ✅ - Hero section with stats and features
- `/komutlar` ✅ - Commands page with categories, search, and copy functionality

## 🚧 Remaining Tasks (Optional Enhancements)

### 1. Page Enhancements
- **`/servers` page** - Could add search, filter toggles (nice-to-have)
- **`/manage/[serverId]`** - Already feature-complete, possible minor UI tweaks
- **`/nrc/about`** - Could add 3D coin animation with Three.js (optional)
- **`/komutlar`** - Could add keyboard nav (↑↓ Enter) for command selection

### 2. Testing (Future Work)
- Unit tests for utility functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests with Playwright for critical flows
- Responsive testing across breakpoints

### 3. Monitoring & Logging (Future Work)
- Backend structured logging with Pino/Winston
- Frontend error tracking with Sentry (optional)
- Performance monitoring
- Socket.IO connection metrics
