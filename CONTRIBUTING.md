## Coding Guidelines

### TypeScript Style Guide

* Use TypeScript for all new code
* Enable strict mode
* Use meaningful variable names
* Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
* Use interfaces over type aliases when possible
* Prefer `const` over `let`, never use `var`

### Example:

```typescript
/**
 * Validates user input for the form
 * @param input - The user input to validate
 * @returns Validation result with errors if any
 */
export function validateInput(input: string): ValidationResult {
  const errors: string[] = []
  
  if (!input.trim()) {
    errors.push('Input cannot be empty')
  }
  
  return {
    isValid: errors.length === 0,
    errors,
  }
}
```

### React/Next.js Guidelines

* Use functional components with hooks
* Keep components small and focused
* Use custom hooks for reusable logic
* Implement proper error boundaries
* Use `'use client'` directive only when necessary
* Optimize images with next/image
* Use dynamic imports for code splitting

### Example Component:

```typescript
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/Button'

interface MyComponentProps {
  initialValue: string
  onSubmit: (value: string) => void
}

export function MyComponent({ initialValue, onSubmit }: MyComponentProps) {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue)
  
  return (
    <div>
      <input
        value={value}
        onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)}
        className="..."
      />
      <Button onClick={() => onSubmit(value)}>
        Submit
      </Button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### CSS/Styling Guidelines

* Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
* Create custom components for repeated patterns
* Follow the established color palette
* Ensure responsive design (mobile-first)
* Test in multiple browsers
* Maintain accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)

### Testing

* Write tests for new features
* Update tests when modifying existing features
* Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
* Aim for high code coverage

```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Commit Message Format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
* `feat`: New feature
* `fix`: Bug fix
* `docs`: Documentation changes
* `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
* `refactor`: Code refactoring
* `test`: Adding or updating tests
* `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Example:**
```
